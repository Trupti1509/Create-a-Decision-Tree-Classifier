Title: Decision Tree Classifier Using the Iris Dataset

Introduction

In this project, we utilize a decision tree classifier to analyze the Iris flower dataset. A decision tree is a powerful decision support tool that can model complex decision-making processes in a tree-like structure. 

Decision Tree Classifier

A decision tree is a decision support tool that employs a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It is used to model decision-making processes and can handle both chance event outcomes and resource costs, making it a valuable tool in various fields, including data science and machine learning. Decision trees consist of nodes representing decisions, branches indicating possible outcomes, and leaves representing final decisions or outcomes.

Iris Dataset

The Iris flower dataset, also known as Fisher's Iris dataset, is a well-known multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset was created as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It consists of measurements of four features from Iris flowers: the length and width of both sepals and petals, all measured in centimeters. These features were used by Fisher to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish between three related species of Iris flowers.

Tools Used

Python: We use Python as the primary programming language for data analysis, model building, and visualization.

Google Colab: Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, allowing collaborative work on Python projects with easy access to hardware resources.

Libraries: We employ various Python libraries, including Scikit-Learn for machine learning and data analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
